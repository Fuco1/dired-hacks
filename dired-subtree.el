;; Introduction
;; ------------

;; The basic command to work with subdirectories in dired is `i',
;; which inserts the subdirectory as a separate listing in the active
;; dired buffer.

;; This package defines function `dired-subtree-insert' which instead
;; inserts the subdirectory directly below its line in the original
;; listing, and indent the listing of subdirectory to resemble a
;; tree-like structure (somewhat similar to tree(1) except the pretty
;; graphics).  The tree display is somewhat more intuitive than the
;; default "flat" subdirectory manipulation provided by `i'.

;; There are several presentation options and faces you can customize
;; to change the way subtrees are displayed.

;; You can further remove the unwanted lines from the subtree by using
;; `k' command or some of the built-in "focusing" functions, such as
;; `dired-subtree-only-*' (see list below).

;; If you have the package `dired-filter', you can additionally filter
;; the subtrees with global or local filters.

;; A demo of basic functionality is available on youtube:
;; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z26b8HKFsNE

;; Interactive functions
;; ---------------------

;; Here's a list of available interactive functions.  You can read
;; more about each one by using the built-in documentation facilities
;; of emacs.  It is adviced to place bindings for these into a
;; convenient prefix key map, for example C-,

;; * `dired-subtree-insert'
;; * `dired-subtree-remove'
;; * `dired-subtree-toggle'
;; * `dired-subtree-cycle'
;; * `dired-subtree-revert'
;; * `dired-subtree-narrow'
;; * `dired-subtree-up'
;; * `dired-subtree-down'
;; * `dired-subtree-next-sibling'
;; * `dired-subtree-previous-sibling'
;; * `dired-subtree-beginning'
;; * `dired-subtree-end'
;; * `dired-subtree-mark-subtree'
;; * `dired-subtree-unmark-subtree'
;; * `dired-subtree-only-this-file'
;; * `dired-subtree-only-this-directory'

;; If you have package `dired-filter', additional command
;; `dired-subtree-apply-filter' is available.

;; See https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks for the entire collection.
