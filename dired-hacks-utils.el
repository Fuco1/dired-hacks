;; Utilities and helpers for `dired-hacks' collection of dired
;; improvements.

;; This package also provides these interactive functions:
;; * `dired-hacks-next-file' - go to next file, skipping empty and non-file lines
;; * `dired-hacks-previous-file' - go to previous file, skipping empty
;;   and non-file lines

;; See https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks for the entire collection
