;;; Commentary:

;; This package adds more customizable highlighting for files in dired
;; listings.  The group `dired-faces' provides only nine faces and
;; isn't very fine-grained.
;;
;; The definitions are added by several macros, currently available
;; are:
;;
;; * `dired-rainbow-define` - add face by file extension
;; * `dired-rainbow-define-chmod` - add face by file permissions
;;
;; You can display their documentation by calling (substituting the
;; desired macro name):
;;
;; M-x describe-function RET dired-rainbow-define RET
;;
;; Here are some example uses:
;;
;; (defconst my-dired-media-files-extensions
;;   '("mp3" "mp4" "MP3" "MP4" "avi" "mpg" "flv" "ogg")
;;   "Media files.")
;;
;; (dired-rainbow-define html "#4e9a06" ("htm" "html" "xhtml"))
;; (dired-rainbow-define media "#ce5c00" my-dired-media-files-extensions)
;;
;; ; boring regexp due to lack of imagination
;; (dired-rainbow-define log (:inherit default
;;                            :italic t) ".*\\.log")
;;
;; ; highlight executable files, but not directories
;; (dired-rainbow-define-chmod executable-unix "Green" "-.*x.*")
;;
;; See https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks for the entire collection.

FACE-PROPS is a string, a list or a symbol.  If a string, it is
assumed to be either a color name or a hexadecimal code (#......)
describing a color.  If a list, it is assumed to be a property
list describing the face.  See `defface' for list of possible
attributes.  If a symbol it is taken as the name of an existing
face which is used.

EXTENSIONS is either a list or a symbol evaluating to a list of
extensions that should be highlighted with this face.  Note that
if you specify a symbol, its value *must* be known during
compilation and must be defined before this macro is processed.

Additionally, EXTENSIONS can be a single string or a symbol
evaluating to a string that is interpreted as a regexp matching
the entire file name.

HOW is a parameter that is passed directly to `font-lock-add-keywords'
