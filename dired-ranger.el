;;; Commentary:

;; This package implements useful features present in the
;; [ranger](http://ranger.github.io/) file manager which are missing
;; in dired.

;; Multi-stage copy/pasting of files
;; ---------------------------------

;; A feature present in most orthodox file managers is a "two-stage"
;; copy/paste process.  Roughly, the user first selects some files,
;; "copies" them into a clipboard and then pastes them to the target
;; location.  This workflow is missing in dired.

;; In dired, user first marks the files, then issues the
;; `dired-do-copy' command which prompts for the destination.  The
;; files are then copied there.  The `dired-dwim-target' option makes
;; this a bit friendlier---if two dired windows are opened, the other
;; one is automatically the default target.

;; With the multi-stage operations, you can gather files from
;; *multiple* dired buffers into a single "clipboard", then copy or
;; move all of them to the target location.  Another huge advantage is
;; that if the target dired buffer is already opened, switching to it
;; via ido or ibuffer is often faster than selecting the path.

;; Call `dired-ranger-copy' to add marked files (or the file under
;; point if no files are marked) to the "clipboard".  With non-nil
;; prefix argument, add the marked files to the current clipboard.

;; Past clipboards are stored in `dired-ranger-copy-ring' so you can
;; repeat the past pastes.

;; Call `dired-ranger-paste' or `dired-ranger-move' to copy or move
;; the files in the current clipboard to the current dired buffer.
;; With raw prefix argument (usually C-u), the clipboard is not
;; cleared, so you can repeat the copy operation in another dired
;; buffer.

;; Bookmarks
;; ---------

;; Use `dired-ranger-bookmark' to bookmark current dired buffer.  You
;; can later quickly revisit it by calling
;; `dired-ranger-bookmark-visit'.

;; A bookmark name is any single character, letter, digit or a symbol.

;; A special bookmark with name `dired-ranger-bookmark-LRU' represents
;; the least recently used dired buffer.  Its default value is `.  If
;; you bind `dired-ranger-bookmark-visit' to the same keybinding,
;; hitting `` will instantly bring you to the previously used dired
;; buffer.  This can be used to toggle between two dired buffers in a
;; very fast way.

;; These bookmarks are not persistent.  If you want persistent
;; bookmarks use the bookmarks provided by Emacs, see (info "(emacs)
;; Bookmarks").
