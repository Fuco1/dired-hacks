;;; Commentary:

;; Collection of useful dired additions.  I don't want this to become
;; another `dired+', so I'm splitting all the functionality into separate
;; mutually independent packages.  All shared functionality and helpers
;; will be extracted into a single package `dired-hacks-utils', so that
;; will be the only dependence.

;; For information about the individual packages, see README.md,
;; or https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks.
