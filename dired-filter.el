;; Adds much-lacking filtering facilities to dired.

;;  Introduction
;;  ------------

;; The filtering system is designed after ibuffer: every dired
;; buffer has associated "filter stack" where user can push
;; filters (predicates).  These filters are by default
;; logically "anded", meaning, only the files satsifying all the
;; predicates are shown.

;; Some filters take additional input from the user such as part of
;; name, regexp or extension, other filters only use a predefined
;; predicate such as "show only directories" or "omit dot files".

;; In addition, there are two "metafilters", the `or' filter and the
;; `not' filter.  These take other filters as arguments and change
;; their logical interpretation.  The `or' filter takes the two
;; filters on top of the stack, pops them and pushes a filter that
;; matches files satisfying one or the other (or both) filters.  The
;; `not' filter pops the top filter and pushes its logical negation.

;; To enable or disable the filters toggle minor mode
;; `dired-filter-mode'.  Toggling this mode preserves the filter
;; stack, so you can use it to quickly hide/unhide files filtered by
;; the current filter setup.

;; All the provided interactive functions are available from
;; `dired-filter-map'.  You can customize `dired-filter-prefix' to set
;; a prefix for this map or bind it manually to a prefix of your
;; choice using:
;;
;;     (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "some-key") dired-filter-map)

;; The bindings follow a convention where the filters are mapped on
;; lower-case letters or punctuation, operators are mapped on symbols
;; (such as !, |, * etc.) and group commands are mapped on upper-case
;; letters.  The exception to this is `p' which is bound to
;; `dired-filter-pop', which is a very common operation and warrants a
;; quick binding.

;; In addition to filtering, you can also use the same predicates to
;; only mark files without removing the rest.  All the filtering
;; functions of the form `dired-filter-by-*' have their marking
;; counterpart `dired-filter-mark-by-*'.  These are available from
;; `dired-filter-mark-map'.  You can customize
;; `dired-filter-mark-prefix' a prefix for this map or bind it
;; manually to a prefix of your choice using:
;;
;;     (define-key dired-mode-map (kbd "some-key") dired-filter-mark-map)

;; The marking operations are not placed on stack, instead, the marks
;; are immediately updated by "OR"-ing them together.  To remove marks
;; that would otherwise be selected by a filter, use prefix argument
;; (usually bound to `C-u').  To logically negate the meaning of the
;; filter, you can call the function with a double prefix argument
;; (usually `C-u' `C-u')

;; You can use saved filters to mark files by calling
;; `dired-filter-mark-by-saved-filters'.

;;  Stack operations
;;  ----------------

;; To remove the filter from the stack, use `dired-filter-pop' or
;; `dired-filter-pop-all'

;; To break a metafilter apart, you can use `dired-filter-decompose'
;; to decompose the parts of the metafilter and push them back to
;; the stack.

;; You can transpose the filters on the top of the stack using
;; `dired-filter-transpose'

;;  Built-in filters
;;  ----------------

;; Here's a list of built-in filters:

;; * `dired-filter-by-name'
;; * `dired-filter-by-regexp'
;; * `dired-filter-by-extension'
;; * `dired-filter-by-dot-files'
;; * `dired-filter-by-omit'
;; * `dired-filter-by-garbage'
;; * `dired-filter-by-predicate'
;; * `dired-filter-by-file'
;; * `dired-filter-by-directory'
;; * `dired-filter-by-mode'
;; * `dired-filter-by-symlink'
;; * `dired-filter-by-executable'

;; You can see their documentation by calling M-x `describe-function'.

;; Specifically, `dired-filter-by-omit' removes the files that would
;; be removed by `dired-omit-mode', so you should not need to use
;; both---in fact it is discouraged, as it would make the read-in
;; slower.

;; When called with negative prefix argument, some filters can read
;; multiple values.  The resulting predicate is often much faster than
;; having the filter repeated with single argument.  Read the
;; documentation to learn more about the calling conventions.
;; Currently, these filters support reading multiple arguments:

;; * `dired-filter-by-extension'

;; To define your own filters, you can use the macro
;; `dired-filter-define'.  If you define some interesting filter,
;; please consider contributing it to the upstream.

;;  Saved filters
;;  -------------

;; In addition to the built-in filters and your own custom filters,
;; this package provides an option to save complex compound filters
;; for later use.  When you set up a filter stack you would like to
;; save, call `dired-filter-save-filters'.  You will be prompted for a
;; name under which this stack will be saved.

;; The saved filter will be added to `dired-filter-saved-filters'
;; variable, which you can also customize via the customize interface
;; or manually add entries with `push' or `add-to-list'.  If you use
;; customize, calling `dired-filter-save-filters' will automatically
;; save the new value into your customize file.

;; You can delete saved filters with `dired-filter-delete-saved-filters'.

;; To use a saved filter, you can use either
;; `dired-filter-add-saved-filters' or
;; `dired-filter-load-saved-filters'.  The first pushes the saved
;; filter on top of the currently active stack, the second clears
;; current filter stack before loading the saved filter configuration.

;; An example use is to create filters for "logical groups" of files,
;; such as media files, image files or files used when programming in
;; certain environment (for example, show files with .h and .c
;; extensions).  Saved filters save you the time of setting up the
;; filters each time you want this specific view.

;; As a concrete example of above, author uses a saved filter "media"
;; with value:

;;     (extension "ogg" "flv" "mpg" "avi" "mp4" "mp3")
;;     ;; show all files matching any of these extensions

;;  Filter groups
;;  -------------

;; Furthermore, instead of only filtering the dired buffer by
;; removing lines you are not interested in, you can also group
;; lines together by filters.  That is, lines (files,
;; directories...) satisfying a filter will be moved together under
;; a common drawer.  This mechanism works in analogy with ibuffer
;; filter groups.

;; The variable `dired-filter-group-saved-groups' contains
;; definitions of filter groups.  You can create and save multiple
;; filter groups (views) and switch between them by setting the
;; `dired-filter-group' variable.

;; To enable or disable the filter groups toggle minor mode
;; `dired-filter-group-mode'.  Toggling this mode preserves the active
;; filter group so you can use it to quickly group and ungroup the
;; files.

;; Here is a screenshot with an active filter group.  Notice that regular
;; filtering works also with filter groups.

;; Placing the point on the drawer header and hitting `RET' folds it.
;; Hitting `RET' again expands it.

;; http://i.imgur.com/TDUsEKq.png

;; The `dired-filter-group-saved-groups' used in the above screenshot is the following:

;; (("default"
;;   ("PDF"
;;    (extension . "pdf"))
;;   ("LaTeX"
;;    (extension "tex" "bib"))
;;   ("Org"
;;    (extension . "org"))
;;   ("Archives"
;;    (extension "zip" "rar" "gz" "bz2" "tar"))))

;;  Other features
;;  --------------

;; You can clone the currently visible dired buffer by calling
;; `dired-filter-clone-filtered-buffer'.
