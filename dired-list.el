;;; Commentary:

;; Produce a file listing with a shell incantation and make a Dired
;; out of it!

;; This package provides one principal function, `dired-list' which
;; can be used to produce Dired buffers from shell programs outputing
;; text roughly in the format of `la -ls'.

;; For most standard output formats the default filter and sentinel
;; should work, but you can also provide your own if the situation
;; requires it.

;; Most of the time you can pipe a zero-delimited list of files to ls
;; through xargs(1) using

;;   | xargs -I '{}' -0 ls -l '{}'

;; which creates a compatible listing.  For more information read the
;; documentation of `dired-list', for example by invoking

;;   C-h f dired-list RET

;; in Emacs.

;; In addition to the generic interface this package implements common
;; listings (patches and extensions welcome!), these are:
;; * `dired-list-mpc'
;; * `dired-list-git-ls-files'
;; * `dired-list-hg-locate'
;; * `dired-list-locate'
;; * `dired-list-find-file'
;; * `dired-list-find-name'
;; * `dired-list-grep'

;; See https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks for the entire collection.
