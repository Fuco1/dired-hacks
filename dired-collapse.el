;;; Commentary:

;; Often times we find ourselves in a situation where a single file
;; or directory is nested in a chain of nested directories with no
;; other content.  This is sometimes due to various mandatory
;; layouts demanded by packaging tools or tools generating these
;; deeply-nested "unique" paths to disambiguate architectures or
;; versions (but we often use only one anyway).  If the user wants
;; to access these directories they have to quite needlessly
;; drill-down through varying number of "uninteresting" directories
;; to get to the content.

;; This minor mode is in main inspired by how GitHub renders these
;; paths: if there is a chain of directories where each one only has
;; one child, they are concatenated together and shown on the first
;; level in this collapsed form.  When the user clicks this
;; collapsed directory they are immediately brought to the deepest
;; directory with some actual content.

;; To enable or disable this functionality use `dired-collapse-mode'
;; to toggle it for the current dired buffer.

;; If the deepest directory contains only a single file this file is
;; displayed instead of the last directory.  This way we can get
;; directly to the file itself.  This is often helpful with config
;; files which are stored in their own directories, for example in
;; `~/.config/foo/config' and similar situations.

;; The files or directories re-inserted in this manner will also
;; have updated permissions, file sizes and modification dates so
;; they truly correspond to the properties of the file being shown.

;; The path to the deepest file is dimmed with the `shadow' face so
;; that it does not distract but at the same time is still available
;; for inspection.

;; The mode is integrated with `dired-rainbow' so the nested files
;; are properly colored according to user's rules.
