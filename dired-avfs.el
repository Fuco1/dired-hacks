;;; Commentary:

;; Adds AVFS (http://avf.sourceforge.net/) support for seamless archive
;; browsing.  This extension therefore depends on the presence of `avfsd'
;; on your system.  In debian-derived distributions you can usually do
;;
;;     apt-get install avfs
;;
;; `avfs' is probably also available for Mac OS.  You're out of luck on
;; Windows, sorry.

;; Once the daemon is installed, run it with `mountavfs' and everything
;; "Should Just Work^TM".

;; See https://github.com/Fuco1/dired-hacks for the entire collection.
